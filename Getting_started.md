## Femtofox - Getting Started
This guide assumes a certain level of familiarity with [Meshtastic](meshtastic.org), and [Meshtastic nodes](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/).

The Femtofox is similar to, and can functionally replace, a [Raspberry Pi Linux Native Meshtastic node](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/linux-native-hardware/). However, the Foxbuntu OS takes away most of the heavy lifting of a typical install, leaving you free to build your mesh application without the initial hurdles.

### Hardware
To get started, you will need a Femtofox. You can either build or buy one.

#### 1. Building a Femtofox
