# this sets the mac address source to eth0, replacing the previous code that derived a seed from the CPU s/n.
# of course, eth0 also has its mac address derived from CPU s/n, but this way meshtastic uses the exact mac address, instead of a bastardized version converted to a 9 digit int with `| bc | tail -c -9`.
General:
  MACAddressSource: eth0
