### For package maintainer:
# Fill the following fields and choose the options that are in use by this package
# Populate the install, uninstall and upgrade functions
# Remember that this script may be launched in terminal, via web UI or another method, so inputs aren't really possible
# Arguments to the script are stored in $args
# This system supports both interactive and non-interactive installs. For non-interactive installs, $interactive="false". In this cause special instructions to the user should be given as user_message, such as `After installation, edit /opt/software/config.ini`
# Successful operations should `exit 0`, fails should `exit 1`
# Messages to the user (such as configuration instructions, explanatory error messages, etc) should be given as: `echo "user_message: text"`
# Everything following `user_message: ` will be displayed prominently to the user, so it must the last thing echoed
